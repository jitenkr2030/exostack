# 🚀 ExoStack

**ExoStack** is an open-source hybrid AI orchestration platform designed to connect, register, and distribute ML/LLM workloads across a decentralized cluster of edge, cloud, and local GPU devices. Inspired by [Exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo) and [dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack), ExoStack combines the best of peer-based compute and centralized control.

---

## 🌐 Project Goals

- ⚡ **Edge + Cloud Orchestration**: Easily run AI models on edge devices (RPi, Jetson, laptops) or GPU servers.
- 📡 **Hub + Agent Architecture**: Central hub with REST API and agents that self-register.
- 🧠 **On-Device Inference**: Run lightweight models (e.g., TinyLlama, Mistral) locally.
- 🧪 **CLI and Web UI**: DevOps-style command-line tooling plus React-based dashboard.
- 🧩 **Composable System**: Agents, hub, CLI, and UI can all be extended or replaced.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitenkr2030/exostack.git
cd exostack
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2️⃣ Start Hub Server (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn exo_hub.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 3️⃣ Start Agent (on any edge device)

```bash
python exo_agent/agent.py
```

### 4️⃣ CLI Usage

```bash
python exo_cli/main.py nodes     # View registered nodes
python exo_cli/main.py infer     # Trigger inference (WIP)
```

### 5️⃣ UI Setup (Optional)

```bash
cd exo_ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6️⃣ Docker Compose (Optional)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🚦 API Overview (Hub)

| Method | Endpoint    | Description              |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/register` | Agent registration       |
| GET    | `/nodes`    | List registered agents   |
| POST   | `/infer`    | Run inference (future)   |
| GET    | `/status`   | Node/system health check |
